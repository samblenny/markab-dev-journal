<p>Before I write more code, I need to spend some time wrapping my head around
how the old Forth systems actually worked.</p>
<p>For file IO in particular, GForth and other ANS Forth systems have a weird
hybrid of words for eldritch block IO and newer POSIX file IO. Part of the ANS
standardization process involved breaking backward compatibility in various
ways with the old FIG Forth era writings on implementation of Forth internals.
It’s very confusing.</p>
<p>I want to go back to the original FIG Forth era source materials and see if I
can comprehend what the block editor experience was like, and how compilation,
assembly, and interpretation were used in that context.</p>
<h2 id="reading-goals">Reading Goals</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Understand, in specific detail, what the user interface was like in old
Forth systems for editing and compiling Forth source code. I find lots of
confusing references to things like <code>4 LOAD 5 LOAD 6 LOAD</code> as a means to
load blocks… whatever “loading” means. I’m unclear about the relationship
of loading, compiling, and disk IO in the context of blocks. I’m unclear
about UI for switching between editing and running code.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the specific circumstances when compilation was typically used
in old Forth systems, how it was implemented, and how the compiler gets
invoked.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the meaning and usage of “assembling”, “compiling”, and
“interpreting” in writing about old Forth systems. From what I’ve read, it
seems like people using those terms to write about Forth meant something
different than the meanings I’m used to in the context of modern languages
like C, Python, Ruby, Go, Rust, and such.</p></li>
