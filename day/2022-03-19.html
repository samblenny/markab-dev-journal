<h2 id="thinking-about-how-to-implement-forth">Thinking about how to implement Forth</h2>
<p>It’s been a while since read the Stack Computers and IPS books that I linked to
in <a href="2022-03-17.html#books-on-implementing-forth-systems">2022-03-17.html</a>. Did
a deep dive on a bunch of that stuff last year. But, forgot many of the
details. For the last couple days I’ve been reviewing how to bootstrap Forth
systems on new architectures. Also considering how I could approximate that
with C compiled for wasm.</p>
<p>Much of the old writing I’ve found with details on implementing a Forth system
is from the 1980’s or the late 70’s. That stuff mainly covers bootstrapping an
assembler and Forth compiler on 16-bit CPUs using machine language, I guess
because that was the current hardware for hobbyists at the time.</p>
<p>In <a href="2022-03-16.html#refining-priorities">2022-03-16.html</a>, I wrote about how I
was thinking it would be better to skip the step of emulating a virtual CPU,
and instead just implement Forth words in C.</p>
<p>Upon further consideration, that idea has a big problem…</p>
<p>The old books and articles that explain and demonstrate how to bootstrap a Forth
system seem to always define some of the words in machine language. Sometimes
there is also an intermediate assembler stage. Also, the means of implementing
stacks and registers for good performance is specific to each CPU architecture.</p>
<p>From reading alone, my understanding of the old Forth system bootstrapping
explanations is very hazy. I can kinda follow along, but I don’t really get it.
Seems like a situation where I need to actually work the examples.</p>
<p>So, if I want to follow the old examples as closely as I can, I need to be
working at the level of machine language. So, that implies I need an emulated
CPU.</p>
<p>My initial assumption was that emulating a CPU would be slow compared to just
letting an optimizing C compiler do its thing on implementations of Forth
built-in words that I could write in C. The trouble is, I don’t understand how
a Forth kernel works well enough to create one from scratch that factors out
the emulated-CPU parts.</p>
<h2 id="what-cpu-perhaps-rv32i-or-rv32ec">What CPU? Perhaps RV32I or RV32EC?</h2>
<p>If I do attempt to follow an old Forth system bootstrapping example, perhaps by
porting an old FIG Forth implementation to some other CPU, then I will need to
pick a target CPU. Which one?</p>
<p>Performance in terms of work per Watt matters to me a lot more than nostalgia
for old 8-bit or 16-bit computers. Some of the slower computers I work with
have 32-bit CPUs. The faster ones are 64-bit. I feel pretty confident that
targeting 32-bit integer math operations and a 32-bit address space will be a
good choice for performance. That should reduce memory bus activity and avoid a
lot of masks and shifts which would be needed to emulate 8-bit or 16-bit
instructions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I like the idea of using a compressed instruction set. The
idea of using an instruction encoding where some instructions use less than
32-bits seems like a good idea. To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>32-bit instructions: Meh… could bloat rom images. Maybe compress?</li>
<li>32-bit math operations: Yes, good. Definitely this.</li>
<li>32-bit addressing: Yes, good. Definitely this. Matches wasm32.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m wondering about maybe detouring away from WebAssembly for a while to try
bootstrapping an old school forth system in RV32I or RV32EC machine language on
top of QEMU. Perhaps that would be a good way to clarify my understanding of
how Forth systems work without doing a deep dive on implementing a virtual CPU.</p>
<p>Another possibility would be to look in the Stack Machines book for ideas on
designing a 32-bit stack CPU instruction set. Not feeling great about that as a
good use of time. Might be fun to try actually implementing in Verilog on an
iCE40 though. Hmm…</p>
<h2 id="new-script-for-creating-journal-entries">New script for creating journal entries</h2>
<p>I wrote a shell script to automate my process for starting a new journal entry.
Nothing super fancy about it. Mostly just automates what I’ve already been
doing by hand. Did add one step with a <code>sed</code> filter to do YAML single quoted
string escapes because I want to possible avoid trouble with special characters
in the title strings (context is YAML metadata block parsing by Pandoc).</p>
<p>Instead of using Python or Ruby like I might typically do, I decided to go with
the <code>dash</code> shell (<code>/bin/sh</code> on Debian) for its POSIX compliance and ubiquity.
My reasoning is that it would be nice if the script works on a variety of
linux, BSD, and macOS systems with a minimum of extra stuff installed. If
you’ve got a terminal, POSIX shell scripting should work. On the other hand,
there may not be other scripting language interpreters installed. I also don’t
want to rely on GNU bash extensions because, for example, macOS uses the <code>zsh</code>
shell now.</p>
<p>Script to make new journal entries is at <a href="new-entry.sh">new-entry.sh</a>.</p>
