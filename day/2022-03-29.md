## MacForth in Evolution of Forth

While reading a pdf scan of "[The Evolution of Forth]", on page 18 (marked as
p642 in the original), I found a reference to MacForth as *"the first resident*
*development system for the 128K Apple Macintosh, immediately after the Mac's*
*debut in January 1984"*. Apparently MacForth provided full access to all the
graphics routines in the Mac's built-in Toolbox ROM.

The article further explains that lots of early Mac software was written in
MacForth. So, I wondered, could I find any source code or documentation?

## MacForth manual and article scans on archive.org

I found these scans on archive.org:

- [MacForth manual], spiral bound from June 1984

- [MacWorld 8411 November 1984] article about MacForth

## FIG GEnie archive with Forth source

I found this web mirror of an ftp mirror of a FIG filesharing area on the
[GEnie] dialup service from way back in the day:

https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/ftp.dei.isep.ipp.pt/pub/forth/

There is a subdirectory specifically for Mac, which has a number of .ARC and .sit.hqx
archive files containing Forth source code:

### Unpacking old Macintosh archives

This is what I came up with for unpacking the archive files on Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install nomarch macutils unar
man nomarch
man hexbin
man unar
man lsar
nomarch whatever.arc
hexbin -3 whatever.hqx
unar whatever.sit.hqx
```
