title: '2022-05-01: Outer interpreter + number formatting'
---

## Outer interpreter status

The outer interpreter is working well for math operations using the stack. I
can now push numbers in decimal or hexadecimal format, and the basic stack and
arithmetic words work fine. I recently added `hex` and `decimal` words for
setting the number base.


## Improved number formatting

As of today, the `.` and `.S` words use the number base to format numbers as
signed int32 in decimal mode, or unsigned uint32 in hexadecimal mode. The old
number formatter only knew how to do fixed-width 32-bit unsigned hexadecimal.

So, it's now fairly convenient to do basic calculations with the stack.

An example session:
```
decimal   OK
1 2 3 .s  1 2 3  OK
-1 -2 -3 .s  1 2 3 -1 -2 -3  OK
+ + + .s  1 2 -3  OK
+ + .s  0  OK
hex  OK
1 10 ff .s  0 1 10 FF  OK
decimal .s  0 1 16 255  OK
bye  OK
```
