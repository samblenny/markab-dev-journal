<p>A friend asked me the other day what I plan to do next with Markab. That
question got me thinking and inspired what’s starting to look like a bit of a
quest.</p>
<p>I’ve decided I want to be able to write Markab code to build and operate synth
patches in Pure Data (pd “vanilla”). Also, I want to be able to control that
process with irc chat as the primary user interface. The idea is that training
a band of silly robots to play music would probably be fun and also have a fair
possibility of translating well to video.</p>
<p>So far, I’ve written an irc bot to connect a Pure Data (pd “vanilla”) patch to a
private irc channel that I’m hosting from a server on my desk.</p>
<p>This is what it looks like using irc to send Pd messages with instructions to
modify its patch with a tone generator (41KB png):</p>

written in Python to bridge between irc and Pd’s network protocol.</li>

send them all at once without rate limiting by the irc server.</li>

with messages to tell Pd how to clear its subcanvas and then re-create its
tone generator with a volume control receiver.</li>
