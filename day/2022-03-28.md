title: '2022-03-28: Optimizing X11 + i3 + urxvt'
---

## Context

My current plan is to implement three functionally equivalent Forth cores in
x86 assembly, ARM assembly, and WASM. The system will use a small set of core
Forth words as the instruction set for a virtual computer. The rest of the
system's functionality will be implemented in cross-platform Forth.

I want to support three target platforms:

1. Linux + X11 graphics on ARM (e.g. Pi Zero with 512MB RAM + ARM A53)

2. Linux + X11 graphics on x86 (e.g. thin client with 2GB RAM + Intel Atom)

3. Wasm32 + Javascript Canvas graphics (e.g. Chrome on a modern Mac or PC)

For the last few days, I've been reading about assembly language and working
on setting up a low memory x86 Debian configuration with X11, i3, and uxrvt.

The Debian system is a thin client with 2GB of RAM and an Intel Atom CPU, but I
am configuring it to use less than 512MB of RAM for system services, X11, i3,
and user applications. This process is aiming for two objectives:

1. Find a configuration that should work well on very limited ARM systems such
   as the Raspberry Pi Zero W, or 3 A+, with 512MB of RAM

2. Find a configuration that works well over TigerVNC with the thin client


## Reducing RAM use of Debian on x86 thin client

The thin client I'm using as my Linux x86 development machine started off last
year as a KDE-Plasma desktop configuration with a monitor, but now I'm running
it headless with TigerVNC over SSH.

Along the way while setting up i3 and TigerVNC, I'm zapping packages that seem
to be using lots of memory with little benefit. Much of the stuff I'm removing
came from desktop-base and the KDE Plasma.


### Switching from konsole to urxvt

The combination of Debian's alternatives system and i3's method of
automatically locating an installed terminal emulator made it a little tricky
to understand which terminal emulator i3 would pick.

This is the process I followed to peel away fancy terminal emulators until i3's
selected `uxrvt` for its terminal emulator:

1. `ps axjf` to find i3's `$mod+Enter` terminal: `x-terminal-emulator`
2. Use `ls` to race chain of symlinks starting with `x-terminal-emulator`
3. `apt remove konsole termit`
4. Finally end up with `urxvt` which was already installed. It loads super fast
   and uses a bitmap font, but theme is black text on white background with
   ugly scrollbar.

This is an edited console log from following that process:
```
$ # Locate process for i3's $mod+Enter terminal...
$ ps axjf
...
... /bin/sh -c i3-sensible-terminal
...  \_ x-terminal-emulator
...      \_ /bin/bash
$ # determine what the command for process is...
$ file `which x-terminal-emulator`
/usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator: symbolic link to /etc/alternatives/x-terminal-emulator
$ # This is after having removed konsole, so now culprit is termit
$ file /etc/alternatives/x-terminal-emulator
/etc/alternatives/x-terminal-emulator: symbolic link to /usr/bin/termit
```


### Method to analyze memory use with top

1. Start `top` from ssh shell
2. Type `?` to view top's built in help, `q` to exit help
3. Type `f` to edit fields (up/dn: navigate, space: select, `s`: pick sort,
   `q`: finish)
4. Select fields: `RES` (set this as sort with `s`) and `COMMAND`
5. Leave field select screen with `q`
6. On main screen, type `t`, `t`, `t` to turn off the CPU usage summary lines
   and `l` (lowercase L) to turn off the load average lines. The summary should
   now just indicate memory usage.
7. Look for highest values in `RES` (Resident size) field, then do an `apropos`
   from another shell to look up contents of `COMMAND` field (try to figure out
   which service the process came from).
8. Use `apt search` and `apt show` to figure out what the service with the high
   resident memory process is for.
9. Decide if service is useful or if it can be removed


Example of figuring out what high memory process
```
$ # COMMAND field of top contained "ModemManager"
$ apropos ModemManager
mmcli (1)            - Control and monitor the ModemManager
ModemManager (8)     - mobile broadband modem management daemon
$ apt search ModemManager | grep installed
modemmanager/stable,now 1.14.12-0.2 amd64 [installed,automatic]
$ apt show modemmanager
...
```


### Removing unused services, round 1

These are things that I removed in the process of ad-hoc switching from
KDE-Plasma with GUI login to i3 over VNC with SSH login.

```
sudo apt remove geoclue-2.0 libgeoclue-2-0 gir1.2-geoclue-2.0
sudo apt remove packagekit ibus sddm plasma-desktop modemmanager
sudo apt remove konsole termit
sudo apt autoremove
# make sure urxvt is installed
sudo apt install rxvt-unicode
```


### Resulting memory usage

After I did all the `sudo apt remove ...` stuff mentioned above, I rebooted
and set up a workspace with:
- Two active SSH sessions
- Emacs open in one of the SSH shells to edit this file
- VNC connection to X with i3 and one open terminal window (konsole)

The resulting 10 highest memory using processes from `top` were:
```
   RES COMMAND
 63640 Xtigervnc
 29920 i3
 25372 emacs
 17308 NetworkManager
 16436 udisksd
 16288 pulseaudio
 15216 x-terminal-emul
 10736 systemd
 10504 tigervncserver
  9680 gsettings-helpe
```

And free memory looked like this (268 MiB):
```
$ free -h
         total       used       free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:     1.9Gi      268Mi      811Mi        20Mi       815Mi       1.4Gi
Swap:    975Mi         0B      975Mi
```


### Removing unused services, round 2

After Debian 11.3 came out this past week, my thin client wanted to install
cups, and sane-utils. I let it finish the upgrade, then did another round
of memory trimming:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt remove cups sane-utils
sudo apt autoremove
apt search kde | grep install
sudo apt remove desktop-base
# I need these to compensate for automatic installs by desktop-base:
sudo apt install x11-apps x11-session-utils xinit xorg xbitmaps iw
apt search kde | grep install | grep -v automatic
sudo apt remove kde-spectacle kwrite khelpcenter
sudo apt remove kwin-x11 konqueror konq-plugins kfind keditbookmarks kcalc
sudo apt autoremove
```

Resulting memory use with 2 ssh shells, emacs, TigerVNC, i3, and urxvt (258 MB
as checked with `top`):
```
MiB Mem :   1895.4 total,    790.3 free,    257.5 used,    847.5 buff/cache
MiB Swap:    976.0 total,    976.0 free,      0.0 used.   1468.8 avail Mem

   RES COMMAND
 60692 Xtigervnc
 29980 i3
 24200 emacs
 18828 x-terminal-emul
 17612 NetworkManager
 16272 pulseaudio
 14476 udisksd
 10656 systemd
 10428 tigervncserver
  9536 wpa_supplicant
  ...  ...
```


## Making urxvt less ugly

By default, the `urxvt` terminal emulator comes up with an ugly scrollbar,
colors not to my liking, an ugly anti-aliased font, and a weird ISO4755 Unicode
character entry popup thing mapped to Ctrl-Shift.

Configuring `urxvt` to improve all that stuff requires setting options in
`~/.Xresources` as `urxvt` does not have its own configuration file.

This is what I came up with for `~/.Xresources`:
```
! To reload this file while X is running, do:
!  `xrdb -display :1 -load .Xresources`

! Fonts
URxvt.font: -*-fixed-medium-r-normal--18-*-iso10646-*,-*-fixed-*-ja-18-*-iso10646-*
URxvt.boldFont: -*-fixed-bold-r-normal--18-*-iso10646-*,-*-fixed-*-ja-18-*-iso10646-*
URxvt.italicFont: -*-fixed-medium-o-normal--18-*-iso10646-*,-*-fixed-*-ja-18-*-iso10646-*
URxvt.boldItalicFont: -*-fixed-*-*-normal--18-*-iso10646-*,-*-fixed-*-ja-18-*-iso10646-*
URxvt.lineSpace: 1

! Window edges
URxvt.scrollBar: false
URxvt.internalBorder: 10

! Hide pointer during typing
URxvt.pointerBlank: true

! Disable ctrl-shift unicode input popup
URxvt.iso14755: false
URxvt.iso14755_52: false

! Configure Ctrl-Shift-c and Ctrl-Shift-v for copy and paste
! This does not work properly. It manages to get the selection synced
! with the clipboard, but C-S-c and C-S-v do not work.
URxvt.perl-ext-common: default,clipboard,selection-to-clipboard
URxvt.keysym.C-S-c: perl:clipboard:copy
URxvt.keysym.C-S-v: perl:clipboard:paste

! Colors
! If this looks weird, things to check:
! 1. Do you have `$depth = "24";` in `~/.vnc/tigervnc.conf`? If you have it set
!    for "16", the colors below will not be accurate
! 2. What is going on with `PS1=...` in .bashrc?
! 3. What is going on with `dircolors` in .bashrc (for setting LS_COLORS)? See
!    `man dircolors` and `man dir_colors` (not the same thing) for info on how
!    the LS_COLORS colors control `ls` output.
! 4. IMPORTANT: DO NOT PUT COMMENTS ON SAME LINE AS COLOR CONSTANTS
URxvt.depth: 24
URxvt.background: #000000
URxvt.foreground: #e8e8e8
URxvt.cursorColor: #872f2d
! normal colors
! 0=black, 1=red, 2=green, 3=yellow, 4=blue, 5=magenta, 6=cyan, 7=white
URxvt.color0: #000000
URxvt.color1: #9d1641
URxvt.color2: #72a703
URxvt.color3: #aaa550
URxvt.color4: #3d7fef
URxvt.color5: #7756b3
URxvt.color6: #44a1b5
URxvt.color7: #c0c0c0
! Brighter versions of colors 0..7
URxvt.color8: #74705d
URxvt.color9: #f9266f
URxvt.color10: #9de32c
URxvt.color11: #e3db74
URxvt.color12: #50abf0
URxvt.color13: #ae81fe
URxvt.color14: #66d9ef
URxvt.color15: #e6e6e6
```

## Testing urxvt terminal colors

The `colortest` and `nyancat` packages are useful for testing if the
`~/.Xresources` color configurations look good:
```
sudo apt install colortest nyancat
colortest-8
colortest-16
colortest-16b
colortest-256
nyancat
```

xfontsel
- Invoke as `DISPLAY=:1 xfontsel -print` from ssh to launch in i3 and print
  selected XLFD string to ssh terminal after quitting xfontsel
- `helvetica`, `lucida`, and `fixed` all look pretty good
- `iso10646` is useful to filter for fonts with better Unicode support

xlsfonts
- Useful in combination with xfontsel
- `xlsfonts` lists full XLFD string for fonts matching specified `-fn ...`

## Attempting to take screenshots with PrtSc key inside VNC

Check what happens if I try to press PrtSc key on macOS tenkeyless keyboard
```
$ xev -display :1 -event keyboard
...
KeyPress event, ...
    root ...,
    ..., keycode 253 (keysym 0xffca, F13), ...,
...
```

Turns out my PrtSc key is mapping as F13

```

Try again with keycodes from mac extended keyboard w/o caps/ctrl swap
```
$ xev -display :1 -event keyboard | grep -o 'Press\|Release\|keycode.*)'
```


## X.org keyboard config notes

I tried `xkeycaps`. It looks kinda cool with nice visual keyboard layouts,
but its list of keyboard types seems to be hardcoded and very old. Does
not seem to match `/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.lst`.


X.org keyboard and layout options

- List of all possibilities: `/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.lst`

- Interesting keyboard types: apple, apple_laptop, applealu_ansi, applealu_iso,
  chromebook

- Interesting options
  ```
  ctrl:nocaps      # Caps Lock as Ctrl
  caps:escape      # Make Caps Lock an additional Esc
  caps:super       # Make Caps Lock an additional Super
  caps:hyper       # Make Caps Lock an additional Hyper
  caps:menu        # Make Caps Lock an additional Menu key
  altwin           # Alt/Win key behavior
  apple:alupckeys  # Apple Aluminium: emulate PC keys (PrtSc, Scroll Lock, Pause, Num Lock)
  ```
