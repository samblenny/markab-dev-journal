<h1>2022-06-12: Python VM is done-ish</h1>
<p>I’ve been more in building mode than writing mode for the past week. Or,
rather, the writing efforts have gone into code, README updates, and commit
message mini-essays.</p>
<p>Two main developments:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I’ve been building a virtual machine emulator in Python for a stack machine
CPU with text console IO. The VM mostly works now with a fairly complete set
of opcodes and moderately comprehensive tests. There are some things I
intend to change and extend. But, for now, the VM is good enough to start
working on a kernel and assembler. For the tests, I’ve been assembling by
hand, including calculating addresses for jumps and branches.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve been contemplating how to articulate what Markab is about as a project,
and who it’s intended for. Going forward, I plan to be more clear with
communicating that Markab is an art project. I’m building a VM and a
Forth-like language because I want those tools to help me make the work I
want to make, as part of an art practice.</p>
<p>Also, I’ve decided to abandon any pretense of attempting to follow
traditional Forth naming conventions or standards. I will continue using
system architecture design elements from the Forth tradition: data and
return stacks, the dictionary, inner and outer interpreters, and so on. But,
I will go my own way with naming of words. I plan to borrow math and logic
operator naming from C. The rest is to be determined.</p></li>
