<h2 id="reading-on-forth-compilers-starts-a-quest">Reading on Forth compilers starts a quest</h2>
<p>Reading about building Forth compilers got me started on a quest for remote
desktop access from macOS, via vnc, to X11 on linux. It’s complicated. The
punchline is that I want to use my regular macOS workstation to write a native
linux-x86-64 X11 client in assembly, or maybe C.</p>
<p>When I started reading about Forth compilers, one of the resources I found was
Jeff Fox’s Ultratechnology website. Jeff has a number of essays on Forth along
with transcripts of talks by Chuck Moore. On the subject of building Forth
compilers, they both seem to agree that building a “portable” Forth system with
the low-level bits coded in C is a very bad idea. Such systems apparently run
much slower than what is possible when core Forth words are implemented in
machine language, which they advocate.</p>
<p>The harsh views on building a portable Forth system on top of C caught me by
surprise, as that’s exactly what I had been planning to do. As I read more
around this subject, the sense I’m getting is that…</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If you want to get low-power, high-performance results like an old school
Forth graybeard, you must think about solving problems as a Forth graybeard
would. (I am very interested in performance per watt on old and low-powered
computers, so this is important.)</p></li>
<li><p>An old school Forth graybeard would not build a Forth system in C. They seem
to more or less hate C. Never mind POSIX and “everything is a file”, their
systems don’t even have files!</p></li>
<li><p>If I want to get the real Forth experience, which I do, I will need to, at
least for a while, suspend my conditioned expectations from decades of
exposure to POSIX systems and C programming. The most obvious one is that,
“Writing in C99 is the obvious way to achieve portability.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If I’m gonna chase the hardcore old school Forth implementer experience, might
as well act like I’m serious, right?</p>
<p>In that case, I guess I need to implement the core of my Forth compiler and
threaded interpreter for Markab in machine language. And, since I want it to be
portable, I will need at least three machine language cores: linux-x86-64 for
regular Linux on Intel/AMD CPUs, linux-arm-32 for Raspberry Pi, and wasm32 for
systems that can comfortably run Chromium, Firefox, Chrome, or Safari.</p>
<p>On the face of it, “Oh, yeah, sure… I’m gonna do a multimedia Forth system in
assembly language for X11” seems like a bit of a stretch? I don’t know. I’m
feeling inclined to try it and see what happens.</p>
<p>And, that’s where I hit an obstacle. Among my collection of old computers, I
have just one comfortable monitor and keyboard setup suitable for extended
coding sessions. That system runs macOS, but I will need access to an X11
display running on Linux. Normally, I run my other computers headless and
connect with SSH over my local network.</p>
<p>I know about the XQuartz.org X11 server for macOS, but the fact that Apple
dropped support for it makes me nervous about security. So, I decided to try
the macOS VNC client with an SSH tunnel to a VNC server running in Debian
Bullseye on a headless x86-64 thin client. That seems to be working great, but
it took some effort. I think this setup will let me begin working in
linux-x86-64 assembly to attempt implementing the core of a Forth system with
graphics support.</p>
<h2 id="tigervnc-server-on-linux-macos-vnc-client">TigerVNC server on Linux + macOS VNC client</h2>
<p>Setting up a VNC server on Debian was a learning experience. Some highlights:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Don’t use TightVNC because it is, as best I could determine, affected by a
bug which scrambles the keyboard mapping in a confusing and hard to diagnose
manner (something to do with Qt versions &lt; 5.11).</p></li>
<li><p>Use TigerVNC with <code>-localhost</code> and an SSH tunnel. It works great. This
assumes you have already installed i3 and know how to use it (if not, it’s
great, you should try it):</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install tigervnc-standalone-server
# Configure server for use with SSH tunnel
mkdir -p ~/.vnc
cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;&gt; ~/.vnc/tigervnc.conf
$session = &quot;i3&quot;;
$desktopName = &quot;_&quot;;
$depth = &quot;16&quot;;
$geometry = &quot;800x600&quot;;
$localhost = &quot;yes&quot;;
$SecurityTypes = &quot;VncAuth&quot;;
EOF
# Turn off annoying fullscreen clipboard config window that comes up in i3
# 1. Edit /etc/X11/Xtigervnc-session as root (e.g. sudo emacs ...)
# 2. Change `tigervncconfig -iconic &amp;` to `tigervncconfig -nowin &amp;`
#
# Start server (this should prompt for a VncAuth password)
tigervncserver :1</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Open SSH tunnel from macOS like this (leave it running in a terminal tab):</p>
<pre><code>ssh -C -L 5901:localhost:5901 username@linux_box</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Open macOS built-in VNC client (“Screen Sharing”) connection like this:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Finder &gt; Go menu &gt; Connect to Server…</li>
<li>Enter ‘<a href="vnc://localhost:5901" class="uri">vnc://localhost:5901</a>’ in the box, click Connect</li>
<li>Enter the VncAuth password at the prompt</li>
<li>In the resulting Screen Sharing window: resize window to as big as
it will go, right click toolbar, pick Customize Toolbar…, add the
‘Cursor’ control, use the new cursor button to turn off the super
annoying double-cursor.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>When done, close the X display by quitting Screen Sharing or clicking the
close button on the macOS title bar above the X11 display window. Use
control-C in the SSH terminal tab to close the SSH tunnel. And, on the
Debian server, use <code>tigervncserver -kill :1</code> to stop the VNC server.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="x11-keyboard-config-for-i3">X11 keyboard config for i3</h2>
<p>Keyboard setup for proper modkey behavior in i3 is a work in progress:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Initial attempt with TightVNC was a disaster due to what, as far as I can
tell, was probably a bug in <code>tightvncserver</code>. Symptom was that <code>XKB</code> did not
load properly, leaving the <code>x.org</code> server very confused about the keyboard
type and keyboard layout. Normal typing in a shell mostly worked, but the
keycodes for modkeys were scrambled (similar to configuring X with an
incorrect keyboard type).</p></li>
<li><p>Modkeys in i3 with TigerVNC work much better, but still not perfect. Things
like <code>$mod+Enter</code> and <code>$mod+Shift+space</code> work fine. But, for example, typing
<code>$mod+Shift+2</code>, which is supposed to move a window to workspace 2, doesn’t
do that. Instead, it acts like <code>$mod+2</code> and just switches to workspace 2. Not
sure why this is happening.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m learning a lot about X keyboard configuration (<code>xev</code>, <code>xmodmap</code>, …)</p></li>
<li><p>I’m learning a lot about X font configuration (<code>xfontsel</code>, <code>xlsfonts</code>, …)</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="x-keyboard-config-diagnostic-tricks">X keyboard config diagnostic tricks</h3>
<p>These examples demonstrate the command line switch, <code>-display :1</code>, for running
a command from macOS Terminal, via SSH shell to the Debian system running
TigerVNC (<em>not</em> a shell in the X display) that uses the TigerVNC display as its
X server. This arrangement is convenient for making configuration changes while
attempting to debug weirdness with X and i3.</p>
<p>Check how modkeys are configured:</p>
<pre><code>$ xmodmap -display :1
xmodmap:  up to 4 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):
shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x69)
mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x6c),  Meta_L (0xcd)
mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
mod3      
mod4        Super_L (0x85),  Super_R (0x86),  Super_L (0xce),  Hyper_L (0xcf)
mod5        ISO_Level3_Shift (0x5c),  Mode_switch (0xcb)</code></pre>
<p>Monitor keycodes as as keys are pressed (also try <code>man xev</code>). This console log
is edited for clarity (zap newline after Press/Release, add comments). I’m
using a tenkey-less keyboard with PC keycaps connected to macOS:</p>
<pre><code>$ xev -display :1 -event keyboard | grep -o &#39;Press\|Release\|keycode.*)&#39;
# Shift
Press   keycode 50 (keysym 0xffe1, Shift_L)
Release keycode 50 (keysym 0xffe1, Shift_L)

# Ctrl
Press   keycode 37 (keysym 0xffe3, Control_L)
Release keycode 37 (keysym 0xffe3, Control_L)

# Win (press... this is really weird)
Press   keycode 50 (keysym 0xffe1, Shift_L)
Press   keycode 64 (keysym 0xffe7, Meta_L)
Release keycode 50 (keysym 0xffe1, Shift_L)
# Win (release)
Release keycode 64 (keysym 0xffe9, Alt_L)

# Alt
Press   keycode 64 (keysym 0xffe9, Alt_L)
Release keycode 64 (keysym 0xffe9, Alt_L)

# $mod+Shift+2 (this is really weird)
# Alt (press &amp; hold)
Press   keycode 64 (keysym 0xffe9, Alt_L)
# Shift (press &amp; hold)
Press   keycode 50 (keysym 0xffe1, Shift_L)
# 2 (press; this is super mysterious... pressing 2 releases shift?!?)
Release keycode 50 (keysym 0xffe1, Shift_L)
# 2, Shift, Alt (release) -&gt; releasing these produces no further events

<p>Print the whole currently configured keymap (edited for length):</p>

<h3 id="playing-with-bitmap-fonts-for-i3status">Playing with bitmap fonts for i3status</h3>
<p>The default Pango font for <code>i3status</code> was drawing with annoying blurry
anti-aliasing. But, I fixed it.</p>
<p>Explore available fonts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><code>xfontsel -display :1 -print</code> from SSH shell connected to Debian box</p></li>
<li><p>Switch to VNC client with X display window (now showing <code>xfontsel</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Select an X Logical Font Description (XLFD) filter by left clicking on the
words in the line with “-fndry-fmly-wght-slant-sWdth-…”. This uses old
school X11 UI conventions, so you need to click and hold while you move the
cursor over a selection, then release to pick it.</p></li>
<li><p>Suggestion for good i3status font:</p>
<pre><code>font -*-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-*</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Click the <code>quit</code> button when done. Because of the <code>-print</code> switch, your
selected XLFD string should print to the SSH shell.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I haven’t figured out yet how to take a screenshot from inside the x.org VNC
display window such that I can show the mouse making a selection. Did learn
that my PrtSc key acts like F13, but that didn’t help me much. Maybe there’s
a way in i3 config to make F13 take a screenshot. Probably. I’ve been looking
at it from the xkb config angle.</p>
<p>This will show specific available bitmap fonts matching an XLFD string:</p>
<pre><code>$ xlsfonts -display :1 -fn &#39;-*-fixed-*-*-normal--1?-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-*&#39;

<h2 id="conclusion-whats-this-got-to-do-with-markab">Conclusion: What’s this got to do with Markab?</h2>
<p>On first look, maybe this VNC + i3 + X11 config quest seems unrelated to
Markab, which I’ve presented so far as substantially about building an
interactive multimedia creation and playback system using Forth. But, really,
this is all very much related. The connecting thread is my desire for a
personalized, low-maintenance, low-impact, graphical computing environment that
can be migrated across hardware, and operating systems, over time.</p>
<p>Part of what I mean by “personalized” is not having my eyeballs constantly
assaulted by other people’s design choices which do not suit my taste, or which
are inappropriate for my hardware. Toward that end, <code>i3</code> configured with nice
bitmap fonts is great.</p>
<p>Part of what I mean by “low-maintenance”, and “low-impact” is that I want to
arrange for making good use of whatever computers come my way (typically by
donation or auction purchase), without having to buy much new stuff or draw a
lot of watts. I typically use an old Mac for my main workstation and SSH to a
collection of Raspberry Pi, thin clients, or old laptops, when I want to run
code on Debian or other Linux distros.</p>
<p>Said another way, I don’t use the common high-spec, high-cost, high-watt
developer workstation with dual monitors, lots of RAM, and a virtual machine
monitor for working with different operating systems. Rather, I prefer to have
one main power-efficient workstation with a single monitor, then SSH out to
Raspberry Pi, thin clients, or whatever else I have on hand, when I want to
run code on a Linux distro.</p>
<p>So, ultimately, this little quest is about getting set up to type at my main
workstation while writing and testing graphics code on three platforms. For
macOS and Chrome, my target will be wasm32 machine language. For Debian and X11
on x86, my target will be x86-64 machine language. For Raspberry Pi OS and X11,
my target will be arm-32 machine language. I’m considering the possibility of
also targeting Plan 9 on Raspberry Pi, but I’m less enthusiastic about that.</p>
<p>This seems obvious to me, but, to state it plainly for your benefit, the goal
of a truly low-power multimedia creation system means wasm32 on a modern
browser is insufficient as a sole target platform (so I claim anyhow). Wasm is
necessary for live web-hosted demos and supporting people who own fancy new
computers with proprietary operating systems. I want those people to be able to
try Markab. But, modern browsers need lots of RAM, lots of power, and lots of
screen space for all their silly over-designed button and menu things. That is
incompatible with my goal to support using low-power devices obtained cheaply
from the used market, surplus, donations, or whatever. I also don’t want to
have to look at screen space taken up by UI for ugly toolbars, tabs, and menus.</p>
<p>I want a system that will work comfortably on a wimpy thin client, a Raspberry
Pi (not just the fancy new ones), and older laptops, with maybe 512MB to 2GB of
RAM and a small display. I also want it to look good, respond quickly, and
generally be fun to use. A foundation of i3, X11, and well selected bitmap
fonts ought to support that goal. Preparing to make that all work through VNC
and SSH tunnels reduces the need for developers (like me) to operate more than
one monitor. That’s good, because monitors use lots of power.</p>
<p>Another unstated thing I should spell out – I’m designing for battery power.
Hopefully, we will collectively get our act together and do something
meaningful to address energy related pollution as a driver of climate change.
If so, people will need lower power computing options. Also, bad weather
imposes unscheduled outages.</p>
<p>In that context, ability to operate from battery power will become increasingly
more important to increasingly more people. For me, now, it already is. Grid
power here mostly works, but during storms and high winds, the power often
glitches. By keeping my dev LAN’s total wattage low, I can power it from a
small, affordable UPS. This lets me work cheaply and with fewer interruptions
due to bad weather.</p>
<p>In short, I want Markab to work comfortably on small computers running from
solar power and batteries. My benchmark for that is, would this design probably
work for Devine and Rekka on Pino? If the answer is yes, then it should also
work for a lot of other people. Targeting X11 on Linux for graphics rendering
should allow for substantially lower power than would be possible with wasm in
a fancy browser, but wasm support is still important as an entry point.</p>
