title: '2022-03-22: Forth screen editing'
---

## Status

Currently reading through a bunch of Forth stuff and taking notes on paper.


## Impressions of Screen Editing

The screen editor stuff I'm reading about from Fig-Forth systems is giving me
mixed feelings. Some of it sounds very interesting to experiment with. Some of
it sounds antiquated and unsuitable.


### Intriguing Points

- Screen based editing with `LIST`, `LOAD`, `INDEX`, and such looks like a good
  way to organize code on a system where Forth is running on bare metal and you
  cannot, or don't want to, rely on filesystem drivers or the typical POSIX
  file IO routines that come with a C standard library.

- The Ultratechnolgy blog has transcripts of Chuck Moore's videotaped talks. In
  one, Chuck mentioned he was working on code in one big file. Chuck said he
  missed the old screen editing as a way of structuring his code. This aligns
  with my feeling that screen editing might be an interesting way to work.

- Having screens of a known, fixed, power of 2 length makes it possible to use
  very efficient access patterns for `LOAD`, `LIST`, and `INDEX`. Instead of
  parsing through a long file, or precalculating and caching index data
  structures, it's possible to seek to predictable locations.

- The concept of using screen 0 for a "load screen" sounds pretty cool.


### Avoiding Trouble with Anachronistic Cruft

Some hardware constraints that motivated aspects of old Forth screen editor
designs are no longer applicable on modern hardware. Also, old designs, while
efficient in the era when Forth systems commonly ran on bare hardware, present
compatibility problems if running on an OS with modern POSIX tools.

- The old convention of fixed size screens of 64 characters by 16 lines (1024
  bytes) was apparently motivated by two no-longer-valid assumptions: One,
  ASCII is a sufficient character encoding; Two, RAM is scarce enough that disk
  blocks will need to be regularly read into, and flushed out of, RAM buffers
  during editing and running of code.

- Old screen editing UIs from the Fig-Forth era seem to be mostly based on
  teletype-style line editors. Tiny Forth for C64 and VIC-20 had an interactive
  editor with cursor key navigation that sounded pretty reasonable. But, most
  of the other screen editor stuff I read about sounded intolerably primitive.
  Better than punchcards or toggle switches, I suppose, but that's a low bar.

- Text in fixed length screens does not play nice with modern text editors
  which generally expect arbitrary numbers of characters per line, non-ASCII
  encoding formats, line-ending characters, and an arbitrary number of lines
  per file. If you open a screen file in a regular modern text editor, making
  changes could very easily corrupt the file.

- Screen encoded text does not play nice with the modern ecosystem of POSIX
  command line tools (git, grep, etc.) that expect text to follow UNIX text file
  conventions.


Conclusions:

- Forth, approached with a Chuck Moore style mindset, exists in a world where
  POSIX, C calling conventions, and similar concerns are not things you need to
  worry about. Being able to import and export data in interoperable formats is
  important. But, inside the cm-style Forth system, it's all about simplicity
  of the overall hardware and software implementation. And, simplicity, as
  Chuck Moore tells it, is largely about not dragging along unrelated cruft
  that creates complexity above and beyond the inherent complexity of the task
  at hand. Corollary: standards and libraries are usually bloated with cruft
  and should therefore be viewed with great suspicion.

- Experimenting with an emulated VM system that presents an interface from a
  similar mindspace, where POSIX and C were never requirements, sounds fun.

- Markab could have an editor with code structured in fixed size screens, but
  with modern-ish UI (vi/emacs/nano nav shortcuts) and support for Unicode. I
  want to experiment with what that feels like to code in. Maybe the editor
  could allow for UTF-8 and free-form line lengths within a screen, using
  normal line-ending sequences, but have a fixed size limit for the screen as a
  whole. There could be a remaining bytes indicator similar to remaining
  character indicators in SMS texting and micro-blogging apps.

- It would be cool to have a screen editor that could accommodate the concept
  that a screen might contain Unicode text, binary encoded numeric data tables,
  raster images, or audio samples.

- Markab could include a POSIX command line utility to pack and unpack
  resources, converting between a single Markab VM memory image and a directory
  of text, image, and sound files. The Markab VM could load a memory image file
  into its emulated address space at startup, then save changes back out to to
  disk as needed. The memory image files could be unpacked for committing to
  git or interoperating with text, image, and sound editors from the POSIX
  mindspace.
