title: '2022-03-10: Makefile for new WASM module'
---

Update: the new WASM module works. It draws a test pattern with a binary
counter. Demo is at https://samblenny.github.io/markab/www/

Today's task: build a WASM module from C with LLVM to generate a test
pattern in the shared framebuffer.


## Notes on compiling C to WASM with only clang and Makefile:

## POSIX Makefile notes

The five internal macros:
- `$@` : full target name of current target -- from `lib.a: file.c`, `$@` means `lib.a`
- `$%` : for archive library members, from `lib.a(file.o)`, `$%` means `file.o`
- `$?` : list of prereq's newer than current target
- `$<` : for inference rule, `$<` is filename that triggered the rule (sorta like `$@`)
- `$*` : current target minus its suffix


## LLVM compiler versions supporting wasm32 target

Apple's build of clang for macOS does not support the wasm32 target, but
apparently the homebrew build does? Have not personally verified that.

Check clang targets of Apple's clang v13 build (wasm32 not included):
```
$ clang --print-targets | grep 'x86\|wasm'
    x86        - 32-bit X86: Pentium-Pro and above
    x86-64     - 64-bit X86: EM64T and AMD64
```

Check clang v11 targets on Debian 11:
```
$ clang --print-targets | grep wasm
    wasm32     - WebAssembly 32-bit
    wasm64     - WebAssembly 64-bit
```

Check clang v11 targets on Raspbian Buster:
```
$ clang-11 --print-targets | grep wasm
    wasm32     - WebAssembly 32-bit
    wasm64     - WebAssembly 64-bit
```
Note that on Buster, `/usr/bin/clang` is clang v7, which is too old. But,
Buster has clang v11 as a package. You just have to `sudo apt install clang-11`
and then invoke it as `clang-11`.
