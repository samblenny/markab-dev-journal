<h2 id="assembly-is-awesome">Assembly is awesome</h2>
<p>I’ve been having a lot of fun coding in ia64/amd64 assembly in NASM. My
comments and commit messages at <a href="https://github.com/samblenny/markab-lab" class="uri">https://github.com/samblenny/markab-lab</a> have
many more details on specifically what I’ve been doing, so I won’t repeat all
that here.</p>
<h2 id="stacks-and-system-v-abi">Stacks and System V ABI</h2>
<p>The System V ABI <a href="https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/elf/x86_64-abi-0.99.pdf">AMD64 Supplement</a>, which is part of the <a href="https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/">Linux Standard Base</a>
specifications, explains some very important things, including:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>How registers and stack frames are used for argument passing to C-style
function calls</p></li>
<li><p>Which registers get preserved by the callee during such function calls</p></li>
<li><p>How the stack is prepared by <code>exec</code> before your process starts. This
includes an explanation of the initial stack frame layout with <code>argc</code>,
<code>argv</code>, and <code>envp</code> for command line arguments and environment variables.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It looks like I should be able to use the stack from <code>exec</code> as my stack
machine’s return stack. That should be compatible with also using the same
stack for syscalls, X11 library calls, and perhaps whatever other libraries I
might have to use for doing audio IO.</p>
<h2 id="indirect-addressing-with-lea-and-mov">Indirect addressing with LEA and MOV</h2>
<p>One surprising gotcha gave me some trouble today. It turns out that if you do
an indirect address calculation for <code>MOV</code> or <code>LEA</code> where a register gets
multiplied by a scaling factor, the previous values of <code>RAX</code> and <code>RDX</code> will get
stomped on during that calculation. Probably this is documented somewhere, but
the ia64 and amd64 programmer’s manuals are enormous. As far as I can tell, the
behavior for an indirect address calculation matches up with the documented
behavior for a qword <code>MUL</code>, which is supposed to put its result in <code>RDX:RAX</code>.</p>
