<p>Had a bunch of fun yesterday with html and css of the index file for the dev
journal. So, decided to keep working on it today. Also did a bunch of reading
and thinking on old video modes and display hardware.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Moved the embedded style block out to a css file to prepare for maybe
rendering these markdown journal entries as html. Also changed to a better
method of vertical spacing between entries in the index.</p></li>
<li><p>Workflow for editing markdown: Made a template file that’s easy to copy.
Figured out some emacs tricks (mainly ruler-mode) to make it more convenient
to edit with a 79 character fill-mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Side quest: Image search for “IBM Selectric” and “DOS word processor”.
Wanted to see their rulers. Results were awesome. 5 stars. Would recommend.</p></li>
<li><p>Side quest: Ebay search for “IBM selectric II font balls”. Also good. This
makes me curious about how many relatively high quality IBM bitmap typefaces
may be floating around besides just Courier.</p></li>
<li><p>Side quest: Blake Patterson’s Byte Cellar blog and vintage computing
screenshot photo albums</p>

<p>This turned into a meditation on what is it that’s so appealing about
retro graphics, visually? (excluding nostalgia factor)</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mediation-on-what-makes-a-video-mode-look-good">Mediation on, what makes a video mode look good?</h2>
<p>Reflecting on having spent a few hours sifting through all the stuff I’ve
linked to here, on the surface it looks random. But, I feel it’s actually
mostly on task for the framebuffer, video mode, and color palette stuff I’m
currently thinking through for Markab.</p>
<p>I’m trying to work out to what extent I agree or disagree with uxn’s approach
to using a limited color palette. I’m also considering the question of how
much configurability of video modes is helpful, and at what point it becomes
problematic by offering too many choices.</p>
<p>Having looked at many computers and printed material in person, and having
tonight just sifted through many of photos of different text and games graphics
on a variety of displays, I’m trying to articulate what looks good and why.</p>
<p>Thoughts and observations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Text on low resolution monochrome character LCDs on portables like the TI
CC-40, Epson PX-8, and modern cheap graphing calculators looks great.
Clearly defined edges, good contrast (sorta… in the right light), and big
enough to read at arm’s length. I think this has to do with the fact that
monochrome LCD pixels can be big while also having a solid shape with
clearly defined edges. You can’t do big pixels in the same way with a color
LCD because each pixel has separate red, green, and blue sub-pixels.</p></li>
<li><p>Text and graphics on the old Macintosh 9" CRTs looks great in a way that
clearly improves upon lower resolution screens like on the Apple II series.
That might sound so self-evident as to not be worth writing down, but I’m
trying to think through and articulate, specifically, what is it that makes
that difference?</p></li>
<li><p>In particular, what’s different about old low-res graphics rendered on a
blurry color video CRT (Apple II, etc.), old hi-res graphics rendered on an
old crisp monochrome CRT (Mac Plus), emulated retro graphics on modern LDCs,
and modern pixel art rendered on modern LCDs?</p></li>
<li><p>I’m picturing all these considerations as points on a 3D graph with axes:</p>
<ul>
<li>quality of color palette design</li>
<li>sharpness of pixels</li>
<li>size of pixels</li>
</ul>

<p>For color palette quality, to my eye, monochrome automatically ranks as very
good, particularly for green or white phosphor. The contrast between black
and green or black and white is very good. For monochrome LCD, the contrast
can be similarly good, allowing for favorable conditions of ambient light,
viewing angle, temperature, and contrast adjustment.</p>
<p>For color CRTs on retro hardware, some of the color palettes look okay, but
many look pretty bad. For sharp lines like text and rectangular window
borders, the effect is even worse on blurry low res color composite CRT. For
example, Apple’s GS/OS on the IIgs with the Apple Color Composite monitor
looked gross. But, conversely, for some low resolution pixel art, blurry
pixels can actually make it look better on an old junky CRT.</p>
<p>Screenshots of game art on the Mac Plus CRT have a really different quality
to them which, I think, comes from the combination of crisp contrast and
dithered shading. Apple’s early Macintosh productivity apps, used black text
on a white background which looks like a credible imitation of paper.</p>
<p>Mac Plus game graphics seemed to use a black background, white foreground,
and dithered shading (not always). This looks not at all like paper. Vibes
were more of caves, haunted mansions, dungeons, outer space, and perhaps a
bit Tron-ish. The dithered shading thing works because the resolution is
pretty high.</p>
<p>Conclusions…</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Sharpness and contrast are very important for text and line art</p></li>
<li><p>Perceived quality of low resolution color seems to depend heavily on
color palette. With good color selections, blurry graphics can look
pretty good even on a garbage display. This is much less true for text
though, unless the type size is quite large.</p></li>
<li><p>Monochrome on a display with sharp pixels generally looks awesome. It
works with big chunky pixels. It works with little pixels. Blurry pixels
are less good, but that issue has gone away with the monochrome CRTs.</p></li>
<li><p>Dithered shading on a monochrome display mostly works once the resolution
gets higher. On 320x200 composite video resolution, dithering seems maybe
less appropriate than a high contrast monochrome pixel art rendering
style. At higher resolution, like 512x342 for Mac Plus, dithering is
great.</p></li>
<li><p>Going further forward in time to screenshots for Amiga, SGI, Windows, and
newer Macs, the screen sizes got larger and took on a distinctly more
cluttered feel. It seems like maybe, once there are enough pixels on the
screen to go beyond the bare minimum for rendering 80 columns of text,
available space starts getting jammed full of toolbars, scrollbars,
buttons, boxes, borders, icons, and other assorted clutter.</p>
<p>At some point in screen resolution growth, it looks like screen space
started getting rapidly colonized by “design” and brand logos. Not as bad
as magazine ads, but seemingly inspired by a similar type of thinking.</p>
<p>I wonder if maybe a big part of the retro computing and pixel art appeal
is that it reaches back to a format where there is less room for things
which are non-essential. When available pixels are precious, they get
allocated with greater care, and the resulting experience is better.</p></li>
<li><p>Enthusiasm for “low-distraction” writing setups seems maybe motivated by
this same problem where modern operating systems have evolved to a form
that happily obliges the corporate desire to jam branding into eyeballs.</p></li>
<li><p>Choosing to work with low screen resolutions could be viewed as an immune
response against branding and ads. Perhaps enthusiasm for retro computing
is not always as much about liking the old aesthetics as it is about the
urge to flee from modern advertising?</p></li>

<h2 id="emacs-save-as-for-starting-new-file-from-template">Emacs save-as for starting new file from template</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open template file</li>
<li>Use <code>C-x C-w</code></li>
<li>Type new filename and RET at the prompt to save it with a new name</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="emacs-ruler-mode">Emacs ruler-mode</h2>
<p>Turning on ruler-mode with <code>M-x ruler-mode RET</code> puts a ruler across the top of
the terminal window. Ruler bar Looks like this (fill-column set at 72):</p>
<pre><code>0....!....1....!....2....!....3.#..!....4....!....5....!....6....!.¦..7.¶..!....</code></pre>
<p>There’a a <code>¶</code> to mark fill-column, a <code>¦</code> to mark the cursor’s current column.</p>
<p>Looks a lot like the ruler on an IBM Selectric typewriter. Vaguely like some of
the ruler features on DOS-era word processors. Similar to MS Word 1.0 and 5.5.
Not much like WordStar. DOS word processor rulers seemed to have a bit more
emphasis on indicating location and type of configurable tab stops.</p>

<p>It’s an automatic typewriter. There are the usual typewriter-y bits, but there
was also a configuration with two paper tape readers that could be used for in
a mail merge feature for typing form letters! I had no idea such machines
existed. Wow.</p>

different than emulator screenshots.</p>

<li>Foreground/background contrast on a monochrome CRT with border area and bezel

the CRT. I’m not explaining it well.</li>
