## No pranks here

In the US, it's traditional to make mischief on this day of this month. But, as
with other unfortunate traditions, I prefer to steer clear. This is just a
normal post.


## Learning about threaded interpreter models

I've been trying to understand the different threaded interpreter models that
have been used to implement Forth systems. The clearest reference, by far, that
I've found on the subject is Brad Rodriguez's [Moving Forth] series.

[Moving Forth]: https://www.bradrodriguez.com/papers/moving1.htm

As I understand it, the type of threading you select determines which data
structures you need to use for your dictionary, the algorithm and resulting
efficiency of your inner interpreter, and the complexity of your compiler. It
seems there are typically significant tradeoffs in performance versus
complexity of implementation. That's important to understand when analyzing old
FIG-Forth implementations because they were designed for ease of portability as
a primary goal, at the expense of performance.

### Summary of Moving Forth

- **Indirect Threaded Code** (ITC): Used in FIG-Forth and commonly described in
  books. Dictionary headers for compiled words contain two pointers, one for
  the machine code implementing the word's action (inner interpreter, literal
  loader, etc.), and a second for "parameters" to be used by the machine code
  (addresses of headers for words to be called, literal values, etc.). Words
  involved in the machine code implementations include `ENTER`, `NEXT`, and
  `EXIT`. The downside of ITC is that it requires two layers of pointer
  dereferencing to reach the machine code for a word's action.

- **Direct Threaded Code** (DTC): DTC puts the machine code for word's action
  in the dictionary header for that word. So, instead of a pointer to the code,
  header holds the actual code, or perhaps a jump instruction to a shared
  subroutine. This saves one pointer dereference. Brad Rodriguez prefers this
  type of implementation.

  There is an important size and speed tradeoff for the `NEXT` inner
  interpreter word at the end of each machine code block. Invoking `NEXT` with
  a `JMP` can save space, depending on the architecture, but inlining the
  machine code for `NEXT` is likely to be faster. Since `NEXT` runs frequently,
  it has big impact on overall system performance.

- **Subroutine Threaded Code** (STC): STC puts a sequence of subroutine calls
  in the dictionary header for each word. So, instead of a list of addresses
  that get processed by the inner interpreter, the header has machine code with
  `CALL` instructions. Depending on the architecture, STC may perform better
  than DTC, based on the number of available registers, speed of `PUSH` and
  `POP` to return stack, and other factors. Key difference is that STC uses
  `CALL` and `RET` instead of an the inner interpreter as used by ITC or DTC.
  It's also possible to inline machine code for short words instead of
  `CALL`ing them.


### Threading model mentions by Jeff Fox

According to Jeff Fox's [Ultratechnology blog] (scroll down to "10/23/10
Silicon Valley Forth Interest Group Meeting" heading), subroutine threading
with inlined native code is a common implementation method for modern Forth
systems. Also, the [Ultratechnology forth0] page says that Chuck Moore's
MachineForth "uses subroutine threading for defined words".

## Assembly with NASM

I've started experimenting with amd64 (intel64) assembly to try out some of
the ideas I'm reading about with the different threading models.

Initial experiments are at:
- https://github.com/samblenny/markab-lab/tree/main/asm/amd64

Some useful references:

- https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/

- https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html
  (programmer reference manuals describing registers, opcodes, etc.)

- https://blog.rchapman.org/posts/Linux_System_Call_Table_for_x86_64/
  (good blog post on invoking syscalls on ia64)

- https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v5.10/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl
  ("64-bit system call numbers and entry vectors")

- https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v5.10/arch/x86/include/asm/syscall_wrapper.h
  (explains x64 argument to register mapping for syscalls)

- https://stackoverflow.com/tags/x86/info (lots of x86/ia64 assembly links)
