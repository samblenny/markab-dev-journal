<p>My existing markdown to html workflow went like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Start a new journal entry by using the <code>day/new-entry.sh</code> shell script to
automatically name a Markdown file with the current date and fill in some
metadata and template stuff. The script also updates my main index file.</p></li>
<li><p>Write my entry in Markdown.</p></li>
<li><p>Run <code>make</code> to have Pandoc generate html using the <code>pandoc_template.html</code>
template.</p></li>
<li><p>Preview using the local web server ruby script, <code>/webserver.rb</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Commit and push to GitHub, which causes the static html to be published on
GitHub Pages.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="new-workflow-with-atom-feed">New workflow with Atom feed</h2>
<p>To publish an Atom feed, I’ve added a Python script, <code>day/feed.py</code>, that gets
invoked by <code>make</code> to construct the Atom feed with the help of Pandoc. The feed
script works like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Look in the current working directory for files with names ending in <code>.md</code>.
In those files, look for a YAML metadata section that contains the date,
copyright and link fields needed for the <code>day/atom_template.html</code> pandoc
template. (my older journal entries only have a “title” metadata field)</p></li>
<li><p>Filter the Markdown files with the full set of metadata fields to select the
10 most recent journal entries.</p></li>
<li><p>For each of the 10 most recent entries, invoke Pandoc to convert the Markdown
file into an xhtml serialized HTML5 fragment, enclosed in some additional
xml to form an xml fragment for a full Atom entry. This uses the template
at <code>day/atom_template.html</code>, and the html extension is important for telling
Pandoc which rendering option to use (HTML5).</p></li>
<li><p>Insert the Atom entry xml fragments into another template to form the full
Atom feed (this template is a string in <code>day/feed.py</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Save the Atom feed xml to <code>/feed.atom</code>. The <code>.atom</code> file extension is
important to make GitHub pages serve the file with the right content-type
header.</p></li>

<h1>2022-07-08: Getting close to self-hosting</h1>
<h2 id="progress-on-relative-addressing">Progress on relative addressing</h2>
<p>Since last update, I converted the Markab VM <code>BZ</code>, <code>BFOR</code>, <code>JAL</code>, and <code>CALL</code>
instructions to use program counter relative addressing. This means the code
for compiled words can be relocated to a different address in memory and still
work.</p>
<h2 id="split-dictionary-with-hashmaps">Split dictionary with hashmaps</h2>
<p>I converted my previous single linked-list dictionary into two vocabularies,
each with its own hashmap. As I had been hoping, the hashmaps make compiling in
the VM much faster. I’ve arranged it so that the kernel rom image includes the
hashmap for the core vocabulary. The core vocabulary hashmap allows <code>find</code> to
locate jump addresses for all the words in the kernel and compiler. The <code>boot</code>
word then creates a second hashmap at runtime for the extensible vocabulary.
The extensible vocabulary’s hashmap holds jump addresses to words that are
defined after the kernel is running in the VM.</p>
<p>Over the past week, I spent a lot of time working on a C program to brute-force
search through combinations of parameters and bin counts to use for string hash
functions. It wasn’t obvious at first how to rank the results, but I settled on
sorting results in ascending order first by the maximum number of hash
collisions, then by the count of bins with a collision frequency above the
median collision frequency.</p>
<p>In the core and extensible vocabulary hashmaps, each of 64 bins holds a pointer
to the head item of that bin’s linked list. Currently, the kernel has 166
words. The core vocabulary’s maximum list length for a bin is 4, and the median
is 3.</p>
<p>For now, the linked lists for hashmap bins use absolute addresses. So, if I
were to copy the memory region for the extensible vocabulary into a rom file,
it would not work when loaded into low memory. The code for compiled words
would be fine, but the hashmap’s linked-list addresses would be wrong.
Converting the hashmap list links to relative addressing is one of the last
remaining tasks to complete a self-hosted build of the kernel and compiler.</p>
<h2 id="compiling-the-kernel-with-cat">Compiling the kernel with cat</h2>
<p>For the moment, instead of adding file IO to the Markab VM, I’ve been using
the <code>cat</code> shell command to pipe markab source code into a VM instance running
the kernel. It seems to work fine. My make target for <code>make selfhost</code> does:</p>
<pre><code>cat mkb_autogen.mkb kernel.mkb | ./markab_vm.py</code></pre>
<p>Since I fixed a bug with comment handling, <code>make selfhost</code> seems to work. But,
working only means that all the words are getting compiled into the extensible
vocabulary. I still need to make the hashmap link addresses relocatable, and I
still need to devise a way of exporting the extensible vocabulary’s memory
region to a file.</p>
<p>I could build file IO into the kernel, but I’m tempted to just use a hexdump
for the export. For that to work, I would need an additional tool to convert
the hexdump to a binary rom image file. Something like using the <code>xxd</code> command
line utility, invoked as <code>xxd -r -p kernel.hex kernel.rom</code> might work well.</p>
<p>Using the approach of exporting rom images as hexdumps printed to standard
output would have interesting tradeoffs. One advantage is, it would be
convenient to compile rom images using unix style text processing without
getting bogged down in platform-specific file IO details.</p>
<p>Exporting roms as hexdumps would bypass the need for a sandboxing mechanism to
make file IO safer, and sandboxing file IO is a non-trivial task. The safest
file IO is no file IO, right? Of course, the major disadvantage of no file IO
is that you have no file IO, which is a non-trivial disadvantage. Perhaps using
hexdumps with xxd could be a good starting point to let me focus on getting the
self-hosting compile working without bogging down in file IO.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>My todo list to finish self-hosted compiling:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Convert the hashmap linked-lists to using relative addressing</p></li>
<li><p>Get extensible vocab rom image export working with a hexdump</p></li>
<li><p>Make a script or makefile target for converting a rom image hexdump to
a binary rom image file</p></li>
<li><p>Do a self-hosted compile, diff the self-hosted rom against the bootstrap
compiler’s rom, and resolve any differences</p></li>

<h1>2022-07-02: Working towards self-hosting</h1>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>In my last update, I had the Markab VM working for a hello world rom, and I
was getting started with source code for the Markab kernel rom.</p>
<h2 id="kernel-and-bootstrap-compiler-work">Kernel and bootstrap compiler work</h2>
<p>Since last time, I wrote a bootstrap compiler in Python to transform Markab
language source code for a kernel into a rom image that runs on the Markab VM.
I haven’t quite figured out suitable terminology for talking about the kernel
and the closely related compiler which lives in the same source file. I feel
like I need to factor them apart, but I would first need to add support for
searching multiple vocabularies. So, for now, the kernel and compiler are
smushed together and I refer to them awkwardly.</p>
<p>The kernel/compiler includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outer interpreter to parse text input and look up words in dictionary</li>
<li>Inner interpreter to run words as direct-threaded code</li>
<li><code>: ... ;</code> colon definitions to compile new words</li>
<li>Tail call optimizer for saving code space and doing tail recursive loops</li>
<li>Compiling conditional blocks with <code>if{ ... }if</code></li>
<li>Compiling counted loops with <code>for{ ... }for</code></li>
<li>Compiling of core words, constants, and variables</li>
</ul>
<p>Along the way, I also built several debugging features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Symbol table generation by bootstrap compiler</li>
<li>Instruction tracing in the VM using the symbol table</li>
<li>Memory range dumping</li>
<li>A new error code printing mechanism</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simpler memory map</li>
<li>Several revisions to the VM instruction set to streamline common instruction
sequences, such as for-loops</li>
<li>New test fixture for compiling code in the VM (vs. with bootstrap compiler)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="profiling-and-speed-improvements">Profiling and speed improvements</h2>
<p>Once I got the kernel and compiler working well enough to write tests of code
compiled in the VM, I wasn’t happy with the speed. The bootstrap compiler is
very fast, but compiling just three test words in the VM initially took almost
two seconds.</p>
<p>Using Python’s <code>cProfile</code> profiler, I was able to eliminate or replace some
slow function calls in the VM. Much of the time seems to be spent on dictionary
lookups, so I tried to optimize hotspots in that code path. I got a big speed
boost from re-writing my Markab code for string matching. I got a smaller but
still noticeable boost from frequency-sorting the words in my core vocabulary.
The current kernel rom tests run in about 600ms, down from about 1900ms before
I started the optimizations.</p>
<p>I expect that I can get a substantial additional speed boost by changing the
dictionary data structure from a linked list to a hashmap. With that in mind, I
made a little Python script to evaluate some string hashing functions. My core
vocabulary currently has 163 entries. By my estimate, using a simple polynomial
hash with 128, 64, or 32 buckets would reduce the worst case dictionary search
list length for my current dictionary to 4, 7, or 12 items, respectively.</p>
<p>For now, I am going to leave the dictionary data structure alone and focus on
getting the kernel/compiler in good shape to do a self-hosted compile.</p>
<h2 id="toward-self-hosted-compilation">Toward self-hosted compilation</h2>
<p>To validate that my kernel and compiler are up to a useful level of
functionality, I plan to do a self-hosted compile of the kernel. I’m working
toward using the kernel compiler to compile another instance of itself from
source into a rom image file.</p>
<p>Some of the things I need to reach that goal include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Convert the VM’s branch and jump instructions to use relative addressing.
This will let me compile object code for the new kernel into a different
address range relative to where it will eventually be loaded from the rom
file. I’m currently part way through this conversion.</p></li>
<li><p>Add some sort of file IO capability to the VM with suitable instruction
opcodes and Markab core words to access it. I’m not sure yet how I want to
do this. I definitely want some kind of sandboxing to prevent arbitrary
filesystem access, but I’m not sure about the rest.</p></li>
<li><p>Extend the kernel’s outer interpreter and compiling words to handle more
than one active vocabulary. While compiling the new kernel vocabulary, I
need to be able to use words from the current kernel’s vocabulary. But, the
new kernel’s vocabulary cannot include any compiled dependencies on words
from the current kernel’s vocabulary. I’m not sure yet how I want to do
this.</p></li>
<li><p>Add lots of tests</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>Once I get self-hosted compilation working and tested, I will probably convert
the dictionary from linked list to hashmap. If compilation speed is too slow
while I work toward self-hosting, I may do the hashmap thing sooner.</p>
<p>Once self-hosting and the hashmap dictionary are done, I will probably add core
words and VM opcodes for raster graphics and a pointing device. On the other
hand, if compilation is still annoyingly slow after re-working the dictionary,
I might instead start working on a faster VM in C or assembly.</p>

<h1>2022-06-21: Progress on Markab kernel</h1>
<h2 id="summary-of-recent-work">Summary of recent work</h2>
<p>Things I did since my last update:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hand-assemble a hello-world rom (it works)</p></li>
<li><p>Revise Markab VM opcodes and the corresponding Markab core vocab words, to
make string processing loops more convenient. This includes instructions for
using registers <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> to work with auto-incrementing addresses,
registers <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> to work with temporary values, and some looping stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>Revise my emacs and vim syntax highlighting plugins to keep pace with the
opcode and core vocab changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a bunch of Markab language code for the Markab kernel and compiler.
This is part of bootstrapping the kernel, so I can’t actually run or test any
of this code yet.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="markab-kernel">Markab kernel</h2>
<p>For now, what I’m calling the kernel is perhaps a bit broader in scope than
what is typically included in a traditional Forth kernel. I may end up
refactoring some of this stuff out into libraries once I get it all up and
running.</p>
<p>What I have so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Outer Interpreter words: <code>outer</code> <code>readline</code> <code>dowords</code> <code>word</code> <code>find</code> <code>number</code></p></li>
<li><p>Defining words: <code>var</code> <code>const</code> <code>opcode</code> <code>create</code> <code>:</code> <code>;</code> <code>here</code> <code>allot</code> <code>,</code>
<code>h,</code> <code>w,</code></p></li>
<li><p>Branching words: <code>if{</code> <code>}if</code> <code>for{</code> <code>}for</code></p></li>
<li><p>String and IO words: <code>hex</code> <code>decimal</code> <code>space</code> <code>cr</code> <code>strcmp</code> <code>."</code> <code>.dp</code></p></li>
<li><p>Auto-generated words: constants for opcodes, constants for memory map areas,
and opcode definitions for core words that map directly to a single VM opcode</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The main thing I lack is an inner interpreter to run the opcodes and threaded
code from dictionary entries.</p>
<h1 id="next-steps">Next steps</h1>
<p>Once I finish implementing my first draft of the kernel, I need to compile it.
I want to make Markab self-hosting, meaning that a rom of the Markab kernel
should be able to load a compiler and re-compile itself from source code into a
new rom.</p>
<p>To start that chain of compilation, I need a bootstrap compiler. As far as I
can tell, the traditional methods to bootstrap a new Fourth(-like) system are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Meta-compile” a new kernel using an existing Forth system</p></li>
<li><p>Hand-assemble a new kernel from scratch (you become a human compiler)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Both of those methods suffer from the problem of inscrutability for people who
are not already Forth implementation experts. So far, the few references and
examples I’ve encountered about bootstrapping a Forth(-like) system fall
solidly into the category of “woah, this is super mysterious”. I would like
Markab’s bootstrapping process to be legible and well documented so that people
can understand it with a reasonable level of effort.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I’m tentatively planning to write a bootstrap compiler in
Python, then use the resulting rom to complete the self-hosting process by
recompiling itself.</p>

<h1>2022-06-13: Thoughts on immediate words</h1>
<p>I’ve been thinking about immediate words as part of trying to define a good set
of core words for Markab. The benefit of immediate words is that they make it
possible for a simple compiler to provide high-level language features.</p>
<p>Immediate words are one of Chuck Moore’s design innovations which are simple
and extremely useful, yet also subtle and confusing. This is one of the areas
in reading old Forth books where it has taken me a lot of effort to understand.
Achieving the perspective to appreciate the simplicity is tricky. Understanding
it well enough implement a compiler and define new immediate words is hard.</p>
<p>The essential property of an immediate word is that, when included in the
definition of a new word, it causes the compiler to run some of the immediate
word’s code at compile time. The compile time code gets to use the stack and
CPU to calculate and decide what should go into the dictionary entry that is
being compiled. So, the immediate word’s compile time code gets to determine
what the behavior of its runtime code should be.</p>
<p>For example, this mechanism allows for conditional blocks where, at compile
time while defining a word such as <code>: three? 3 = if{ do stuff }if ;</code>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><code>if{</code> compiles a jump instruction with a temporary address into the
dictionary, then pushes a pointer to the that address onto the data stack</p></li>
<li><p><code>}if</code> at the end of the conditional block calculates the correct jump
address, pops the pointer to the temporary address (pushed by <code>if{</code>), then
patches the temporary address with the correct calculated address.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Many other things are possible using the immediate word mechanism. If you want
the compiler to support some new control flow construct or data structure, you
can define new immediate words to make that happen. You don’t have to change
the language specification or the compiler.</p>

<h1>2022-06-12: Python VM is done-ish</h1>
<p>I’ve been more in building mode than writing mode for the past week. Or,
rather, the writing efforts have gone into code, README updates, and commit
message mini-essays.</p>
<p>Two main developments:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I’ve been building a virtual machine emulator in Python for a stack machine
CPU with text console IO. The VM mostly works now with a fairly complete set
of opcodes and moderately comprehensive tests. There are some things I
intend to change and extend. But, for now, the VM is good enough to start
working on a kernel and assembler. For the tests, I’ve been assembling by
hand, including calculating addresses for jumps and branches.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve been contemplating how to articulate what Markab is about as a project,
and who it’s intended for. Going forward, I plan to be more clear with
communicating that Markab is an art project. I’m building a VM and a
Forth-like language because I want those tools to help me make the work I
want to make, as part of an art practice.</p>
<p>Also, I’ve decided to abandon any pretense of attempting to follow
traditional Forth naming conventions or standards. I will continue using
system architecture design elements from the Forth tradition: data and
return stacks, the dictionary, inner and outer interpreters, and so on. But,
I will go my own way with naming of words. I plan to borrow math and logic
operator naming from C. The rest is to be determined.</p></li>
