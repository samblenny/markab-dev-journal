# Markab Dev Journal

This is the place where I keep notes about writing code for
[Markab](https://github.com/samblenny/markab).

HTML journal entry index is at: https://samblenny.github.io/markab-dev-journal/

For now it just links to the journal entries as plaintext markdown files, with
names according to the date I wrote them.

For now, the html index is hand-coded and just has a reverse chronological list
of journal entries with links to the markdown files as plain text. All this may
change suddenly if I decide I need to reorganize it. There's a moderate chance
that I might rig up a thing to render the markdown to html files. No promises.
This is a new workflow for me. Lots of improvising going on here.
