# Markab Dev Journal

This is the place where I keep notes about writing code for
[Markab](https://github.com/samblenny/markab).

HTML journal entry index is at: https://samblenny.github.io/markab-dev-journal/

On 2022-03-17 I implemented a new system with make and Pandoc to convert the
markdown entries to html. So, now, the html index links to html journal entries
instead of raw markdown files.

All this may change suddenly if I decide I need to reorganize it. This is a new
workflow for me. Lots of improvising going on here.
